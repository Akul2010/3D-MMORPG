# 3D-MMORPG
Absolutely 100% unsupported, and full of infuriating bugs.

No wait, that's not right!

Now it <em>is</em> supported, and it is <em>not</em> full of infuriating bugs! Feel free to fork this project (use for non-comercial projects only).

# Steps to run
1. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed.
2. Open up a new command prompt inside the <kbd>server</kbd> folder, and run `npm install`. You only need to run this once, and then you can continue with the other commands.
3. Run `node index.mjs`. Leave it running in that terminal, and open up a new one in the <kbd>client</kbd> folder.
4. Run `npm install -g http-server`. Again, this is only a one-time step.
5. Now, run `http-server`, and open any of the links given. There it is!

# Notes
1. Steps two and four are the only ones which need to be executed once. All the other commands MUST be executed in order for the game to run.
